# NewMapMaker

This is the new home of NewMapMaker, a _sometimes_ convenient way to make/automate making LA-ICP-MS maps in iolite 3 (2?) (www.iolite-software.com) written as a set of Igor Pro procedures.

# Requirements

1. Igor Pro 6.
2. Iolite 3+ (commercial version for sure). Maybe iolite 2.5... 

# Installation

1. Copy NewMapMaker.ipf to iolite's "Add ons" folder.
2. Restart iolite.

(or just open the procedure file from Igor Pro's File menu if you want to load it manually)
